        Cheers to the <strong>Tailwind Labs</strong> team! üëã
      </p>
      <h3>Introduction üë®‚Äçüíª</h3>
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Pavel Zablockij</strong>{' '}
        <span className="text-zinc-500">
          (You're probably wondering how the hell to pronounce it, right? Well,
          my local friends call me Pavelas, but you can just call me Paul üòÖ)
        </span>
        , and I am a <strong>Software Engineer</strong>. I was born on{' '}
        <strong>January 7th, 1996</strong>, and I grew up in{' '}
        <strong>Vilnius, Lithuania</strong>. I am fluent in three different
        languages: <strong>Lithuanian</strong>, <strong>English</strong>, and{' '}
        <strong>Russian</strong>{' '}
        <span className="text-zinc-500">(Glory to Ukraine üá∫üá¶)</span>. My current
        professional position is <strong>Frontend Software Engineer</strong> at{' '}
        <a href="https://vinted.com" target="_blank">
          Vinted
        </a>
        .

      <h3>Motivation üí°</h3>
      <p>
        I am writing this cover letter to express my interest in the{' '}
        <a
          href="https://tailwindcss.com/careers/design-engineer"
          target="_blank"
        >
          Design Engineer
        </a>{' '}
        position at Tailwind Labs. To be honest, both positions{' '}
        <span className="text-zinc-500">
          (Design Engineer and Staff Software Engineer)
        </span>{' '}
        sound super exciting to me and I'm not sure which one fits me best. ü§∑ I
        have been using Tailwind CSS since the early days of the project and I
        can't remember the last time I built a project without it. You'll be
        able to get to know my Tailwind CSS background in a separate note.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, I discovered that you have open positions only on Friday
        evening while I was scrolling through Twitter.{' '}
        <span className="text-zinc-500">
          (I thought, "Oh, damn, I must hurry up.")
        </span>{' '}
        Due to the Easter Holidays and some ongoing projects, my time was very
        limited. I came up with the idea to build a <strong>Catalyst OS</strong>{' '}
        using{' '}
        <a href="https://vitejs.dev" target="_blank">
          Vite
        </a>
        , <a href="https://react.dev">React</a>,{' '}
        <a href="https://tailwindcss.com" target="_blank">
          Tailwind CSS
        </a>
        ,{' '}
        <a href="https://catalyst.tailwindui.com" target="_blank">
          Catalyst
        </a>
        ,{' '}
        <a href="https://headlessui.com" target="_blank">
          Headless UI
        </a>{' '}
        and{' '}
        <a href="https://heroicons.com/" target="_blank">
          Heroicons
        </a>
        . I spent a few sleepless nights and developed an MVP. However, there
        are still many missing features I would like to implement:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Light Theme</strong> - At the moment only the dark theme is
          available.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Accessibility</strong> - I do care about accessibility, but
          this time I didn't have enough time to implement it properly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Browser Improvements</strong> - I wanted to implement a
          browser feature to act as a real browser, so that you could open
          internal links in the <strong>Catalyst OS</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Global Search</strong> - I wanted to implement a search
          feature like Spotlight or Raycast.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Notes Improvements</strong> - I wanted to implement a Markdown
          editor, so that Notes app could be dynamic and you could write your
          own notes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Settings</strong> - I wanted to implement a settings feature
          where you could change the theme, language, and other settings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Animations</strong> - There are no heavy animations at the
          moment. I had a plan to implement it using{' '}
          <a href="https://www.framer.com/motion/" target="_blank">
            Framer Motion
          </a>{' '}
          a few animations to make the <strong>Catalyst OS</strong> more
          interactive.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Even more so...</strong> - I had many ideas, but not much
          time. I would be happy to discuss and share them with you.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I hope you will find my MVP interesting and sorry for the potential bugs
        and issues. ü©µ
