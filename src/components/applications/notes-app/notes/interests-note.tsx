      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Technologies.</strong> I simply love my job. When I'm bored, I
          read articles, watch courses, play with Arduino, or try to automate
          another workflow that will save a few minutes of my life in the
          future. Or maybe not. 👨‍💻

          <strong>Gaming and esports.</strong> Sometimes I love playing video
          games, but more than that, I love watching professional games. Back in

          online tournaments as well as national LAN tournaments. 🎮

          paragliding pilot's license in 2018. I have never felt so free and
          happy in my life. Since then, I have been traveling and flying in

          amateur team ever since. My player position is Right Defenseman, and
          we improve together as a team, playing in the National Amateur League.
          We have some achievements already, but the main goal, to become league
          champions, has not yet been accomplished. 🏒

          <strong>Astronomy and science.</strong> The universe blows my mind,
          and I feel like the more I learn about it, the more questions arise. I
