        I've mentioned before that <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> is a unique
        tool for me. I can now confidently state that it's the only tool that
        truly helps me build UIs faster and more efficiently. I've never had
        such a great experience with any other tool. I'd love to share the story
        of how I started using <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> and how I've
        convinced my colleagues to use it as well. 🩵
      </p>
      <h3>Timeline 📆</h3>
      <p>
        Before <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, I primarily worked with{' '}
        <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/" target="_blank">
          Bootstrap
        </a>{' '}
        or{' '}
        <a href="https://bulma.io/" target="_blank">
          Bulma
        </a>{' '}
        and I was pretty happy about it. However, I found myself spending
        considerable time removing unnecessary styles and crafting custom CSS
        until I reached a satisfactory solution. Essentially, I was replicating{' '}
        <a
          href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/reboot/"
          target="_blank"
        >
          Tailwind CSS Preflight
        </a>
        , Grid, and certain utility classes for spacings within Bootstrap. It
        was during this period that I realized the potency and adaptability of
        utility classes. 💡
      </p>
      <h4>2018 🩵</h4>
      <p>
        I'm not certain whether it was around 2018 or late 2017, but I remember
        when someone from Laravel community sharing news about{' '}
        <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> early release. I was super excited about
        it, because someone built something I was thinking about for a long
        time. To be honest, I was a bit skeptical about using utility classes
        for everything, so I was thinking that I'll be using it only for
        typograghy, colors, spacings and layouts. I was wrong. 🙃
      </p>
      <p>
        I've started using <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> in my personal
        projects, most of the time in combination with{' '}
        <a href="https://laravel.com/" target="_blank">
          Laravel
        </a>{' '}
        framework. I don't know if you remember, but Laravel was using{' '}
        <a href="https://laravel-mix.com/" target="_blank">
          Laravel Mix
        </a>{' '}
        and it was a bit tricky to configure it to work with{' '}
        <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>. But even with that, I've noticed that
        prototyping UIs became much faster and easier. Also, I've noticed that
        my designs became more consistent and cleaner. 💅

      <h4>2019 - 2020 🎉</h4>
      <p>
        It was the time when I was completely hooked on{' '}

        introduced Tailwind CSS in one of application starter kits. ❤️

        I was using <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> in all of my projects,{' '}

        were dashboard applications. I even utilized it in building React Native{' '}

        <span className="text-zinc-400">
          (When I've just joined the team, they wanted to use Styled Components,
          I remember the day when I've prepared a presentation about Tailwind
          CSS and how it can help us build UIs faster and more efficiently. I've
          also prepared a small demo project to show how it works. After that,
          we've decided to use Tailwind CSS in our project)

        After successfull launch of the project, my colleagues fell in love with{' '}
        <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> as well. 🥰

        , they were impressed by my homework project and the way I've built it
        using <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>. Unfortunately, we're not using it
        in the main project, because we have our own design system and migration
        to <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> is still in progress. However, I'm
        already using it in internal projects and so far everyone is happy with
        it. 🎨
